# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It is the foundation of web pages, allowing developers to structure content and embed multimedia elements.

## Key Features of HTML

- **Elements and Tags**: HTML uses elements, represented by tags, to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., `<tagname>`.
- **Attributes**: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about the element, e.g., `<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>`.
- **Headings**: HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, to define the importance of sections.
- **Paragraphs**: The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs.
- **Links**: The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks.
- **Lists**: HTML supports ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, with list items defined by the `<li>` tag.
- **Images**: The `<img>` tag is used to embed images.
- **Forms**: HTML forms (`<form>`) allow user input and interaction.

## Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sample HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a sample HTML page.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

HTML is a fundamental skill for web development, providing the basic structure upon which CSS and JavaScript can build.
